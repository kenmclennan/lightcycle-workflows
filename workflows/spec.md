# Spec

A brief from co-design becomes a formal spec, committed on an isolated branch of the specs repo,
ready for review (B2) and the PR (B3). Distinct from the code workflow: its worktrees come from
the specs repo (where `specs-remote` points), not a project repo. `open-pr` and `await-merge` are
reused from the code workflow; the PR monitor drives the outcome - a merged PR transitions the
SAME item `spec-merged` into the code workflow at `write-code` (one id spans brief -> spec PR ->
code PR -> merge; C2 turns this into a decomposing planner), a closed-unmerged PR closes it
`abandoned`, and an `@lc` mention routes back to `spec-writer` for rework.
